# COntinuous COin Betting Optimizer (COCOB.py)

This is a Keras implementation of COCOB from the paper

**[Backprop without Learning Rates Through Coin Betting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07795)**  
Francesco Orabona and Tatiana Tommasi  
https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07795  

This is first-order optimization. Please read the paper for more details.

Example codes adapted from Keras examples are also provided.

# SMORMS3 Optimizer (SMORMS3.py)

This is a Keras implementation based on http://sifter.org/~simon/journal/20150420.html

Like other advanced optimization methods such as Adam, Adadelta, SMORMS approximates second-order information from the stochastic gradient.

Hope the optimizer helps.
